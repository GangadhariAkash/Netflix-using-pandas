# Netflix-using-pandas
The goal of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset using Python’s Pandas library. The analysis aims to understand Netflix’s content library by examining trends such as movie vs. TV show distribution, genre popularity, release year patterns, ratings, and country-based production.
